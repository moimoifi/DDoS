# DDoS
A very nice DDOS tool, takes down internets well :D
To run, do cd Downloads, then CD into BootQuicklyy. Then, do python main.py. Any uninstalled modules do
'pip install <module>'
You could also check out my repl.it that accomplishes the same task:

  Run it, and then just follow the questions.
